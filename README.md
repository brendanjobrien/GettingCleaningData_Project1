# Project Description 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. <br>
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project.
<br> 

# Repo Contents

<ul>
<li><b>CodeBook.md</b> - information about the data and how it was transformed</li>
<li><b>README.md</b> - this file </li>
<li><b>run_analysis.R</b> - R script to transform raw data into tidy data and output a table in a text file </li>
<li><b>UCI HAR Dataset folder</b> - contains unzipped raw data. This must be present in the working directory for the R script to run properly. </li>
<li><b>output.txt</b> - Output file from the <i>"run analysis.R"</i> script of the tidy data</li>
</ul>

<br>

## The R script called run_analysis.R should do the following:

<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. </li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set </li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>
